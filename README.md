## 🌟 **Project Overview**  

This decentralized version of Twitter enables users to post, like, and interact with content while maintaining ownership of their data. By leveraging Solana's high-speed and low-cost infrastructure, the contract ensures scalability and efficiency.

### Key Features:  
1. **Decentralized Tweeting**:  
   - Users can create, delete, or update tweets on the blockchain.  

2. **Comments System**:  
   - Support for comments tweets to encourage engagement.  

3. **Ownership of Data**:  
   - Each user owns their posts and interactions directly on the blockchain.  

4. **Efficient Gas Usage**:  
   - Designed with Solana's low-cost structure for minimal transaction fees.  

5. **Fully Tested**:  
   - Includes a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure reliability and performance.
